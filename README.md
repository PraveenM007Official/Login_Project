This is a Project done to Make a user Register their data and Login Using that data in asp.net using c# & some css.

*Note:After creating the Database and stored procedures ,I detached the database from local machine using 
SQL Server Management Studio and moved the '.mdf'&'.ldf' files in a folder called "App_Data" which i created within project files folder and reattach them during sql connection.
